    "**Classes** are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. For example, you want to track the students in your class. You have their name and age as attributes. Here you define a rule to describe each student in yuor class. However, a class just provides structure — it’s a blueprint for how something should be defined, but it doesn’t actually provide any real content itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the class is the blueprint, an **instance/object** is a copy of the class with actual values, literally an object belonging to a specific class. It’s not an idea anymore; it’s an actual student, like a girl named Lily who’s eight years old.\n",

    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major benefits of object oriented programming is reuse of code and one of the ways this is achieved is through the inheritance mechanism. Inheritance can be best imagined as implementing a type and subtype relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to write a program which has to keep track of the teachers and students in a college. They have some common characteristics such as name, age and address. They also have specific characteristics such as salary, courses and leaves for teachers and, marks and fees for students. A good way would be to create a common class called `SchoolMember` and then have the `teacher` and `student` classes inherit from this class, i.e. they will become sub-types of this type (class) and then we can add specific characteristics to these sub-types. The SchoolMember class in this situation is known as the **base class** or the **superclass**. The Teacher and Student classes are called the **derived classes** or **subclasses**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Any changes in any functionality in the base class will be automatically reflected in the sub class as well. \n",
    "* However, changes in the sub class do not affect other sub class or super class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that you can treat instances of subclasses as instances of superclass, and this is called **polymorphism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use inheritance, we specify the base class names in a tuple following the class name in\n",
    "the class definition (for example, `class Teacher(SchoolMember)` ).\n",
